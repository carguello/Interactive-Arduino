## Interactive-Arduino

_Interactive Arduino is a series of activities I developed in Nicaragua with local children that knew nothing about Arduino and Programming and, guess what, I acomplished it._

_By being part of the Zamora Teran Foundation <http://fundacionzt.org/en/> I was able to teach kids 
about general programming, electronics, Arduino kit and joy :blush:._
